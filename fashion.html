            <h2>TYLER, THE CREATOR'S  CULTURAL TAKEOVER WITH GOLF LE FLEUR*</h2>
            <p>Tyler, The Creator's involvement with fashion has started from day one, with his streetwear-heavy looks to match those of Odd Future, the group of friends known for messing about and also becoming generational music icons. Then, there was Tyler's “Yonkers” music video, in which he was seen wearing a now-famous Supreme cap. Symbiotically, Tyler and Supreme became youth culture's new obsession, a phenomenon that would last a decade later as Tyler quickly became a key figure in the rise of streetwear in mainstream and high fashion, dressing his millions of fans with his own merch line titled Golf Wang.</p>
            <p>Then there was Golf le FLEUR*. Unlike Golf Wang which focused on youthful graphics, notably the donut, and vibrant prints like tie-dye, le Fleur* feels like an elevated and matured fashion brand, which makes sense considering fans that had been following Tyler since 2011 had in fact grown and matured by 2016. From its initial Converse collaboration to its latest nature-filled lookbook, keep reading to find out more about Tyler's Golf le Fleur evolution.</p>

            <h2>THE GOLF FASHION SHOW</h2>
            <p>While Tyler, The Creator's 2016 Golf fashion show wasn't officially a GLF* event, it was the precursor for the luxury line to come. With public support from guests such as Kendall Jenner and Kanye West, Tyler's first ever fashion show was very much a hyped up event that got the crowd talking. Sticking to what is the essence of Tyler, the set design included a skate ramp, in which models actually skated and biked through during the show accompanied by an instrumental version of then-unreleased 911/Mr. Lonely. The clothing felt a natural progression to Tyler's aesthetic, while still opting for loud and vibrant colours but also adding pastels to the mix and subtle graphics, giving it a more preppy Californian feel. This showed us a softer side to Tyler, who had made a reputation for his rebellious, loud-mouth nature, which would be further explored in his Flower Boy era. The collection featured an array of pastel tees with the le Fleur* logo as well as a collaborative pair of Converses.</p>

            <h2>IT ALL STARTED WITH CONVERSE</h2>
            <p>What initially introduced the Golf le Fleur* brand was actually introduced in a Golf Wang 2016 fashion show. Tyler had teamed up with Converse to reimagine its One Star shoe in a partnership that is still ongoing. The shoes, which initially came in “Clearwater” light blue colourway, was then released to the public in July of 2017, in line with Tyler's then-new album “Flower Boy”. The shoe, as expected, found huge success, and has now been released in “Airway Blue”, “Peach Pearl”, “Fuschia Glow” and many more colourways. Due to the One Star's massive success, Golf le Fleur* x Converse has now also seen the release of other shoe models, such as the Chuck 70 and the Giano. Till this day, the Star One in its multiple colourways remains one of GLF*'s most successful products, with releases instantly selling out.</p>

            <h2>GOLF GOES SMART</h2>
            <p>In late 2018, Tyler released to his own YouTube channel a video titled “GOLF: Autumn/Winter 2018”, which was a 'Golf Wang/Golf le Fleur*' fashion show-style video shot in the woods. As the models walked down to the camera opened, airy button-up short sleeve tops, a long beige trench coat with the words 'Golf le Fleur*' found on the back, a silk neck scarf and buttoned knitted vests, it was clear that Tyler took this brand seriously. By presenting a smarter, more elevated range of clothing, and while adhering to the typical fashion calendar system with a seasonal show, Tyler was setting up GLF* as being more than an artist's merch line. It was to be a serious fashion brand that created high quality garments. That show was followed by Tyler's release of his fifth studio album “IGOR”, and then the “GOLF: Spring/Summer 2019” show which showcased yet another elevated and smarter take on Golf clothing, in line with Tyler's personal style makeover after the album release. As more output in GLF* logos were released, the brand started becoming known as an entity of its own, separating itself from Golf Wang.</p>

            <h2>TEAMING UP WITH LACOSTE</h2>
            <p>With the Golf le Fleur* tapping Lacoste for a collaboration in 2019, GLF* had now fully separated itself from Golf Wang. This partnership, which was first teased during Tyler's appearance at the French Open in which he wore a pastel pink GLF* shirt featuring the alligator logo, was made up of 16 tennis-inspired pieces. From bucket hats to sweatpants, polo shirts to socks, the collaboration felt right. Aesthetically, the two brands meshed seamlessly, with the notable le Fleur* flower logo smartly placed in the Lacoste croc's mouth. The collection felt like a youthful, refreshing look into old money-favoured designs, which were perfectly aligned with Tyler's own musical ventures, notably his “A Boy Is A Gun” music video which saw the artist flaunt around in a mansion with gardens worthy of Versailles.</p>

            <h2>THE CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST MAKEOVER</h2>
            <p>As per usual, the release of a new album marks an aesthetic reinvention for the artist. 2021's “Call Me If You Get Lost” saw Tyler move up in the echelons of fashion, favouring luxury luggage trunks and ushankas, a traditional Russian fur hat. This of course transpired into his GLF* brand, which doubled down on the smart straight trousers, the round silk collars and neutral and pastel-toned tees and cardigans, whilst also keeping in touch with Tyler's loud personality, with elements such as leopard print and vibrant coloured ties. For its latest collection campaign, GLF* turned to the woods for an earthy-toned collection which also drew inspiration from sportswear with a baseball shirt and cap. Le Fleur* saw itself expanding and establishing itself as an independent luxury brand even more in 2021, with the continual release of its collections and campaign, as well as its own catalogue, a nomadic Malibu-originated store and the venture into perfume, namely “French Waltz”, nail polish and accessory pieces like trunks and notebooks.</p>
            <p>Tyler, The Creator started as a streetwear-heavy skater, with brands like Supreme being his go-to, to now becoming head of a classy yet youthful luxury brand. What looks like two completely different aesthetics are actually connected through Tyler's own personal growth through music and fashion. Golf le FLEUR* is now its standalone brand with a specific DNA and image to it, which remains to attract Tyler's OG fans as well as newer ones.</p>
