            <h2>Artistry</h2>
        
            <p>Okonma's music has been variously considered alternative hip hop, bedroom pop, jazz rap, R&B, and neo soul, while his earlier music was considered horrorcore. Over the years, his style of production has progressed from gritty and dark in early projects such as Goblin, but soon transitioned to a more jazz-based approach, with the album Cherry Bomb, which Okonma described in 2018 as his favorite album. Okonma's fourth album, Flower Boy, "marked the beginning of a new era — a complete departure from the wildly offensive lyrics and dark themes that defined his previous works". Igor, Okonma's first Grammy-winning album, was a deeply personal concept album about "the emotional journey of being the odd man out in a love triangle", while Call Me If You Get Lost, his second Grammy-winning album, was a concept album about "the persona of "Tyler Baudelaire," a suave, well-traveled gentleman with a sophisticated taste for high art".</p>

            <p>Okonma is also known as the leader of Odd Future, and the group as a whole has been compared to the influential hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan. Since the beginning of his career, Okonma has largely self-produced songs for his projects and other Odd Future members; he has been heavily influenced by the production work of The Neptunes member Pharrell Williams, whose debut solo album, In My Mind (2006), had a substantial impact on Okonma, inspiring him to co-found the Odd Future collective. He has also cited Williams' band N.E.R.D's debut album In Search of... (2001) as an impactful album for him. Okonma has named Washed Out, Beach House and Broadcast as influences.[96] He was also initially influenced by rapper Eminem, calling Eminem's album Relapse (2009) one of his favorite albums in 2011. During his acceptance of the Cultural Influence Award at the BET Awards, Okonma thanked Q-Tip, André 3000, Chad Hugo, Kanye West, Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, and Hype Williams as his influences.</p>

            <p>In addition to music, Okonma also is involved in the fashion industry; he runs both Golf Wang, a streetwear company known for its colorful aesthetic, and Golf Le Fleur, a high-end luxury line described to "embody the globe-trotting mise en scène of his latest album Call Me If You Get Lost".</p>
