            <p>I started listening to Tyler in 2017 when I was around 15 years old. He is turly one of those artists that really changed my life. Not only has he inspired me in the way that I dress and what music I like. But he also made me feel more comfortable with being myself. Tyler is truly one of a kind. He like me has struggled with his sexuality for quite some time and it really took him a while to be his most authentic self and express himself in his own way.</p>
